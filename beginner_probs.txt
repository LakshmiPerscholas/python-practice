1.) WRITING IN ALL CAPS IS LIKE YELLING.
Best to use your “indoor voice” sometimes, writing entirely in lowercase.
Write a function that accepts a string and outputs the same in lowercase. Punction and whitespace should be unchanged.

2.) Playback Speed
Some people have a habit of lecturing speaking rather quickly, 
and it’d be nice to slow them down, a la YouTube’s 0.75 playback speed, or even by having them pause between words.
Write a function that accepts a string and replaces each space with "..."

3.)Making Faces
Before there were emoji, there were emoticons, whereby text like :) 
was a happy face and text like :( was a sad face. Nowadays, programs tend to convert emoticons to emoji automatically!
Write a function that acceptes a string and returnss any :) to 🙂 and any :( to 🙁. All other text should be returned unchanges

4.)Even if you haven’t studied physics (recently or ever!), you might have heard that , energy (measured in Joules),  
represents mass (measured in kilograms), and  represents the speed of light (measured approximately as 300000000 meters per second).
Essentially, the formula means that mass and energy are equivalent.
Write a function that accepts an integer(in kilograms) and returns the outputs the equivalent number of Joules as integer.
